                Bhutan is a spectacular place as it is the home to an extraordinary range of natural landscapes and habitats, from subtropical valleys to alpine peaks; 
                you could see Asian elephants, Bengal tiger, red panda, Himalayan black bear, black-necked cranes. 
                There are also rare species such as the golden langur and Macaca munzala. 
                In addition, more than 770 species of bird is estimated to live in Bhutan, 
                including the white-winged duck, which is noticed as globally endangered. 
                Sightseeing all these wild animals, would make it like it was dreaming. 
                There is the most improbable creature even amongst these rare animals; that is Takin.<br>

                There are four subspecies of the Takin: Golden Takin, Mishmi Takin, Sichuan Takin, and Bhutan Takin. 
                Bhutan Takin, a goat antelope, is its national animal, which is so astonishing. 
                Its large head is distinctive by its long, arched nose and stout horns, which are present in both sexes, and followed by a stocky body and a deep chest, which is an amazing body structure. 
                The short legs with two-toed and the highly developed spur, which covers its whole body hooves support it. 
                It is obvious that the non-Bhutanese would not imagine that kind of creature even in the dream. 
                In Bhutan, It is highly valued, as according to the legend, it is somehow associated with the Bhutanese religious history and mythology.

                There are more than 5,400 species of plants in Bhutan, in which Pedicularis cacuminidenta, the indigenous plant, is also included. 
                Fungi is important in Bhutanese ecosystem; while mycorrhizal species provide necessary mineral nutrients to forest trees, 
                microscopic organisms help the natural recycling, as they make wood and litter decay. The Bhutan is regraded as the carbon negative country till now possibly because of the forests, which cover most of the country by 72%, and absorb the air pollution: 
                more than 4 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2,200,000 metric tons of produced carbon dioxide a year.

                On 11 June 1992, Bhutan signed the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity, 
                and became a party to the convention on 25 August 1995. 
                After that it has produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (BAP), with two revisions, 
                which was received by the convention on 4 February 2010.<br>

                The Eastern Himalayas has been identified as a global biodiversity area, 
                and was counted among the 234 globally outstanding ecozones of the world by WWF between 1995 and 1997.<br>

                Bhutan is said to be viewed as a model for proactive conservation initiatives.
                Most Bhutanese, near to 56.3%, are participated in agriculture, forestry or conservation. The government promotes conservation while targeting Gross National Happiness; 
                the Kingdom also has been praised internationally for being committed to the maintenance of the biodiversity of Bhutan: at least sixty percent of the land area is maintained as covered in forests; 
                more than 40% of its territory are kept as national parks, reserves and other protected areas; and a further 9% of land area is identified as biodiversity corridors by linking the protected areas, which allows animals to migrate freely throughout Bhutan. 
                <big>Environmental conservation</big> has been centered of the nation's development strategy; it is not regarded as a sector but rather as an important mainstream in development planning of Bhutan, and its importance has been emphasized by the law; 
                the constitution of Bhutan states about environmental standards in multiple sections. Because of its conservated forests, it had a Forest Landscape Integrity Index 2018, 
                which means it scored 8.85 out of 10, as the 16th among 172 countries.<br><br><br>
