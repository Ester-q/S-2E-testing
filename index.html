                Starting from the monarch to farmers, the citizens of Bhutan are said to be afraid of the possible influences by the outside that would affect the heritages, traditions and culture of Bhutan.
                 Therefore, even the institution with some strict policies is made to preserve and sustain their heritages, traditions and culture identities. 
                Therefore, they are referred as ‘The Last Shangri-La’ for their unspoiled traditional and cultural heritages. 
                They value not only their culture but also the religion, and hence they are known as devoted and religious. 
                In Bhutan, the Vajrayana Buddhism is regarded as the state religion, as most of the traditions of Bhutan derivate from Buddhism. 
                The second most dominant religion is Hinduism, which is also widely spread in the southern regions. 
                There are also other religions but the percentages of the devoted are low. <br><br><br>
