            Bhutan, the Land of thunder dragon, is the only carbon negative country in the world. 
            Bhutan is regarded as the most peaceful, pristine and restful country; education and healthcare is free for all citizens. 
            The citizens are highly secured and safe, and they are extremely honest, as you can know by its lowest crime rates in the world. 
            <big>They are humble and friendly, always with a smile on their face. Moreover, they are peaceful, calm and gentle.</big><br><br>

            Bhutan,<big> during the spring months of March to May</big>, is the most beautiful, with the lively valleys and the delicate tiny snowflakes. 
            The effects of the surroundings, which is full of greenery and unique blossoming flowers, make not only the citizens but also the visitors pleasant. 
            The time when I first arrived there, I had become astonished and fresh that the tiredness, got by trying to get there, was all gone.<br><br>

            Bhutan is located in the eastern edge of the Himalayas so the place itself is tranquil. 
            Its mountainous landscape would definitely make you amazed; because of the long hour windy drive along the mountains, 
            you could be <big>relax and feel the sense of freedom.</big> <br><br>

            After that long hour driving and climbing a bit, I reached at <big>the Tiger’s Nest Monastery</big>, a monastery perched on a cliff. 
            The permission to enter the primary temple, in the center of the courtyard, is hardly granted, but I was lucky enough.
            Quietly, I stepped over the threshold and went into the inner sanctuary. 
            The air is thick with the mixture of smoke, but slowly, I could see the brilliant murals, on the wall, behind the impressive glowing gold and bronze Buddha statues; 
            for a few seconds, I even felt like I am the first non-Bhutanese who has ever seen such a view. After looking around for a while, I went out and breathed some fresh air, and the scenery amazed me; 
            I was overlooking the breathtaking scenery from such an elevation.
            I think I could see all that amazing features: buildings, greeneries, and such.<br>

            The buildings in Bhutan are ancient, extraordinary and antique. 
            <b>By using wooden frames and earthen material, traditional western Bhutanese structures are often made.</b>
            <big>Neither the nails nor iron bars are allowed in the construction. </big>
            <big>The Dzong</big>, the Bhutanese fort, plays an important role as a combined administrative center and monastery. 
            In the past, it defense against enemies, and since then to now, 
            almost every populated valley has Dzong overlooking a stream or river.<br>

            Bhutan is <big>full of the traditional heritages </big>that are <big>still uninfluenced</big> by the nearby neighborhood countries and the outside visitors, or strangers.  
            There is an institution with some policies to <big>preserve</big> these heritages and cultural identities, 
            as the king and the citizens of Bhutan fear the threats to their traditional way of life. 
            Therefore, some parts of their lifestyle are dissimilar from the non-Bhutanese, probably including you, the readers.<br><br>

            Education is highly prioritized, but most of the technologies are <big>being restricted or still not accessible</big>, as the country is not modernized. 
            When you wander around Bhutan, you would certainly notice that the clothing style of the Bhutanese is not like the others that we usually see all over the world. 
            The Bhutanese mostly <big> wear their kimono liked traditional dress</big>: men wear the Gho, a knee-length robe, being tied at the waist by a traditional belt known as Kera; 
            women wear the Kira, a long, ankle-length dress with a light outer jacket known as a Tego, which has an inner layer known as a Wonju. 
            The next is that there are <big>a lot of festivals and rituals</big>, which are distinct from each other. 
            Every village is known for their unique festival, and the most widely known is the annual Tshechu, an annual religious festival. 
            Therefore, you would experience a ritual or festival, amongst those numerous ones.<br><br>

            After you have wandered around and enjoyed experiencing their traditions, I highly recommend you to have a try for <big>the hot stone baths.</big>
            You will surely feel relaxed after a long day of sightseeing. 
            Moreover, the Bhutanese believe it can make you healthy; 
            they told me that it is because they use Menchu (medicinal water) which is fresh river water mixed with Artemisia leaves, 
            and the water is heated using river stones that are roasted on fire till they are glowing red.<br><br>

            So, these are the things about Bhutan: why it is <big>the happiest country</big>, what are <big>the different yet best features</big>, and what you can enjoy there. 
            Eventually, I want to remind you that the tourism in Bhutan is <big>‘low-volume, high value’</big>, and traveling there is adventuring, experiencing what are so rare; 
            it is a land, more than worthy to visit.<br><br><br>
